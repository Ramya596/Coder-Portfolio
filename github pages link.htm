      Frontend Developer</h5>
      <p class="card-text">A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications.
      The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks,
      while back-end refers to how it works.You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.
      The basic languages for Front-End Development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.A front end developer is someone 
      who implements web designs through programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The front end developers 
      work with the design and outlook of the website. Whereas, the back end developers program what goes on behind the 
      scenes like databases. If you head to any site, you can see the work of a front end developer in the navigation, 
      layouts, and also the way a site looks different from your phone.

          markup language used for creating web pages. It is the most basic 
          building block required for developing websites.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
          is the language used for presenting the document you create with HTML.

          4. Responsive Design: We use different gadgets like computers, phones, and tablets to look at web pages. 
          The web pages adjust themselves to the device you re using without any extra effort from your end. 
          5. Version Control/Git: Version control is the process of tracking and controlling changes to your source code so that you dont have to start from the beginning if anything goes wrong.
